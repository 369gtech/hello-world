I am going to complete the **Hello World** Github repository and I am starting from the start.

<em>I am adding a commit about my self - I am an aspiring coder learning to code with **Github**.</em>

Oops I made a little mistake lol, doing take two of Pull request.

<h2><strong>Git Time</strong></h2>

*I went to instal* ***Git Bash*** *but I already installed from before but I didn't understand how to use it, well know I am learning how to use it.*

>Lets stick with **the basics** first before we get too far ahead of ourselves so lets creating a branch.
>
>*Well branch every major topic with a name* feature [name & number] *so we can keep track of our progress.*
>
<ul>
  <li>feature Hello World 1</li>
  <li>feature Set Up Git 2</li>
  <li>feature etc</li>
</ul>

**So lets get started and branch up our progress.**

<h3>Yes we have branched to <strong>feature Hello World 1</strong></h3> 

>That was quick so now well do a pull requeast!!! This should be easy :):):).
>

<h3>Setting up <strong>Git Bash</strong> again as I had previously already done it lol, so Round 2</h3>

>Not interested in adding <strong>Git GUI</strong> as I will be more than happy just to use CodeSandbox. I have also previously completed <strong>Authentication with Git</strong> as I have created an Auth Token in Settings. I have also set up a <strong>Git Clone</strong> so I am on a roll with this section :P.



<h3>Create A Repo</h3>

><strong>Done and Dusted</strong> already and we can move onto the next section :):):).

<h3>Fork A Repo</h3>
